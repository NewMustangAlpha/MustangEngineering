Robot Component Map
1. Central Unit (Hub): Brain of the robot, Receives and processes sensor data and Sends commands to motors
2. Motors: Drive Motors: Provide movement to the wheels (left and right), Steering Motor (if separate): Controls direction or steering mechanism
Arm/Lift 
3. Sensors: Color Sensor: Detects colors and light intensity, Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures distance to obstacles
4. Motors: Steering Motor (Direction Control Motor):
Controls the steering mechanism of the robot and raction Motors (Drive or Propulsion Motors):
Provide the main movement (forward and backward) connected to the wheels or tracks and Control the speed and acceleration of the robot.
5. Wheels and Tires:
Provide traction and mobility
Connected to drive motors
